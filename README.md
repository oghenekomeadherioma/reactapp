## ⚙️ What the Terraform Code Does

- Provisions an **S3 bucket** for React static site hosting
- Configures **bucket policy** and public access settings
- Sets up a **CloudFront distribution** for caching and SSL
- Uses **ACM SSL certificate** (in us-east-1) for HTTPS
- Creates **Route 53 DNS records** to map custom domain
- Automates **React build upload** to S3 using `null_resource` and AWS CLI

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

> 💡 Make sure your IAM user has permissions for S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and ACM.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- AWS account & IAM user configured via `aws configure`

---

### 2. Build the React App

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
## 3. Deploy with Terraform

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Terraform will:

Create all AWS resources

Sync your build/ folder to S3 automatically

Output the public site URL

✅ Output Example
makefile
Copy
Edit
Apply complete!
Outputs:
site_url = "https://www.komzi.online"
🧠 Lessons Learned
How to write modular, reusable Terraform configurations

Automating S3, CloudFront, and DNS via code

Debugging:

-S3 ACL & upload errors

-Domain not resolving

-SSL setup failures

-Using CloudFront console to route domain when Route 53 alias fails

## Challenges Faced
Challenge	Solution
BucketAlreadyExists error	Renamed S3 bucket to a unique name
The bucket does not allow ACLs	Removed --acl public-read since ACLs are disabled by default now
Domain not resolving	Used CloudFront console “Route domain” option
Terraform website/website_endpoint deprecated	Noted AWS provider updates for future migration
